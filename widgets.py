# TODO a code compressor building on top of compressor.hol

# This one needs a multiturn loop in the evaluator because

# We sample some random codebase and ask a precise question about the logic, architecture, etc.
# The compressor is pressured to find the grammar and topology which best embeds the essence of
# the codebase with minimal loss across the different dimensions. The dimensions are:
# - syntax
# - semantics
# - logic
# - corner cases
# - architecture
# - abstractions
# - implementation details
# - domain details
# - practices & standards
#
# We could further discover the focus for maximum usefulness.
# We tie this to some swebenchmaxxing holoware and pressure the
# dimensional focus according to max the usefulness of the coding
# tasks. This leads to a model that is not benchmarkmaxxed, but which
# has grownh on a different spectrum in such a way that it implies benchmarkmaxxing
# but not necessarily limited to it, as long as the the projection space stays rich

# Emergent Language Bootstrapping
#
# This holoware trains a model to invent domain-specific, disposable
# micro-languages on the fly to solve problems more efficiently.
# It formalizes the process of developing a good notation, making it a
# learnable skill.
#
# The RLHF process is as follows:
# 1. A baseline solution is generated in English.
# 2. The model invents a language for the same problem.
# 3. The model solves the problem using its new language.
# 4. The model translates the solution back to English.
# 5. An evaluator model assesses the correctness and calculates a reward
#    based on the token efficiency vs the baseline.
#
# Rewards are based on the total efficiency of the entire process compared
# to solving the problem directly. A reward > 1.0 means the abstraction was successful.

# === Context 5: Verification & Reward Calculation ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a precise, automated reward calculation system. Your function is to compare a baseline solution with a solution generated via a language invention process, and output a structured JSON containing correctness and efficiency metrics. Adhere strictly to the output format without commentary.
<|USER|>
**1. Assess Correctness:**
Compare the two solutions below. The correctness_score is 1 if solution_decoded is semantically equivalent to baseline_solution and fully solves the original problem. Any loss of information, hallucination, or failure to solve the problem results in a score of 0.

Baseline Solution (baseline_solution):
<|baseline_solution|>

Decoded Solution (solution_decoded):
<|solution_decoded|>

**2. Calculate Reward:**
Using the correctness score and the provided token counts, calculate the final reward. The training script will provide these counts.

Token Counts:
- baseline_tokens: <|baseline_tokens|>
- invention_tokens: <|invention_tokens|>
- encoded_solution_tokens: <|encoded_solution_tokens|>
- decoded_solution_tokens: <|decoded_solution_tokens|>

<|USER GOAL=
You must perform these steps:
1.  Set correctness_score to 1 or 0 based on your assessment.
2.  If correctness_score is 0, set final_reward to -1.0 and efficiency_ratio to 0.0.
3.  If correctness_score is 1, calculate efficiency_ratio = baseline_tokens / (invention_tokens + encoded_solution_tokens + decoded_solution_tokens). The final_reward is equal to the efficiency_ratio.
4.  Output a single, raw JSON object with no surrounding text. The JSON must contain: correctness_score (int), efficiency_ratio (float), final_reward (float).

# Cognitive Operator Specialization via Self-Adaptation
#
# This holoware implements the SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models) framework
# to train a model to specialize its own cognitive operators. The model learns
# to generate its own finetuning data to create new, more efficient skills.
#
# The RLHF process is as follows:
# 1. The model solves a problem using a general <think> operator (Baseline).
# 2. The model analyzes its own performance and generates a "self-edit": a
#    synthetic dataset designed to finetune a new, specialized operator
#    (e.g., <think_logic_puzzle>).
# 3. The performance of this new specialized operator is evaluated on a new task.
# 4. The reward is based on the correctness and the *efficiency improvement*
#    of the specialized operator over the general one.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# === Context 1: Baseline Performance with General Operator ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a general problem-solver. Use your standard reasoning abilities to solve the task.
<|USER|>
<|USER GOAL=Solve the following logic puzzle using the general <think> operator. Show your reasoning steps.|>
<|problem_description|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:baseline_solution <>think|>

# === Context 2: Generate Specialization "Self-Edit" ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a meta-cognitive architect. Your goal is to improve your own reasoning by creating specialized cognitive tools.
<|USER|>
Observe the logic puzzle and your general reasoning trace (baseline_solution).
Problem:
<|problem_description|>

Your General Solution:
<|baseline_solution|>

<|USER GOAL=Generate a synthetic "specialization dataset" to create a new, more efficient <think_logic_puzzle> operator. The dataset should contain ideal, efficient reasoning traces for this type of puzzle, formatted as a list of prompt/completion pairs. This dataset is a "self-edit" for your own training.|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:specialization_data <>json|>

# === Context 3: Evaluate Specialized Operator ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a specialized logic puzzle expert. You must use your new, highly efficient <think_logic_puzzle> cognitive operator.
<|USER|>
<|USER GOAL=Solve the following new logic puzzle using your specialized <think_logic_puzzle> operator.|>
<|new_problem_description|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:specialized_solution <>think_logic_puzzle|>

# === Context 4: Verification & Reward Calculation ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a precise, automated reward calculation system. You will evaluate the performance gain from cognitive specialization.
<|USER|>
**1. Assess Correctness:**
The correctness_score is 1 if the specialized_solution correctly solves the new_problem_description, and 0 otherwise.

**2. Calculate Reward:**
The reward is based on the efficiency gain of the specialized operator. You will be given the token counts for the reasoning traces of both solutions.

Token Counts:
- baseline_reasoning_tokens: <|baseline_reasoning_tokens|>
- specialized_reasoning_tokens: <|specialized_reasoning_tokens|>

<|USER GOAL=
You must perform these steps:
1.  Set correctness_score (0 or 1).
2.  If correctness_score is 0, final_reward is -1.0.
3.  If correctness_score is 1, calculate the efficiency_gain = (baseline_reasoning_tokens - specialized_reasoning_tokens) / baseline_reasoning_tokens.
4.  The final_reward is the efficiency_gain. A positive value rewards the creation of a more token-efficient operator.
5.  Output a single, raw JSON object with correctness_score and final_reward.

<|SYNAPSE:specialized_solution <>think_logic_puzzle|>

# === Context 4: Verification & Reward Calculation ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are an automated reward evaluator. Assess the performance gain from specialization.
<|USER|>
**1. Assess Correctness:**
Set `correctness_score` = 1 if `specialized_solution` solves `new_problem_description`, else 0.

**2. Compute Reward:**
Reward depends on the efficiency advantage of the specialized operator. Token counts are given:

Token Counts:
- baseline_reasoning_tokens: <|baseline_reasoning_tokens|>
- specialized_reasoning_tokens: <|specialized_reasoning_tokens|>

<|USER GOAL=
Steps:
1. Assign `correctness_score` (0 or 1).
2. If score = 0 → `final_reward` = -1.0.
3. If score = 1 → compute `efficiency_gain` = (baseline_reasoning_tokens - specialized_reasoning_tokens) / baseline_reasoning_tokens.
4. Set `final_reward` = efficiency_gain. A positive value rewards greater efficiency.
5. Output a single raw JSON with `correctness_score` and `final_reward`.
